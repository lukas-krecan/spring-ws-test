Server test support

  Although there is no need to support server (endpoint) test, Spring WS Test provides you a helper class to simplify such tests.
  So if you want to test your server-side Web Service configuration, you can do something like this:
  
---
@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
//your endpoint configuration + Default helper config
@ContextConfiguration(locations={"classpath:context/server/dispatcher.xml", WsTestHelper.DEFAULT_CONFIG_PATH})
public class EndpointTest {

	@Autowired
	private WsTestHelper helper;
	
	@Test
	public void testCallWs() throws Exception
	{
		//simulates request comming to MessageDispatcherServlet
		MessageContext message = helper.receiveMessage("request.xml");
		helper.compareMessage("expected-response.xml", message.getResponse());
	}
}
